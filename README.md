SYNOPSIS

Given both training and test data from the following study:

Velloso, E.; Bulling, A.; Gellersen, H.; Ugulino, W.; Fuks, H. Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises. Proceedings of 4th International Conference in Cooperation with SIGCHI (Augmented Human '13) . Stuttgart, Germany: ACM SIGCHI, 2013.

the goal of this project, as specified in Professor Leek's instructions, is to “predict the manner in which they did the exercise.”

Further, Professor Leek states that this report should describe:

“how you built your model”
“how you used cross validation”
“what you think the expected out of sample error is”
“why you made the choices you did”
Ultimately, the prediction model is to be run on the test data to predict the outcome of 20 different test cases.
